# dofvimrc
This is my personal configuration for VIM. This configuration is not the definitine one because I really like to change a lit bit when some vim plugins and new configurations help me in my job. Fell free to download it and send to me interesting new configurations.

- vim-airline
- vim-bookmarks
- vim-gitgutter
- vim-javacomplete2
